    <p>FredBoat Improved Edition is the Discord music bot that is arguably 400% as good as any other music bot, given that it
        can play 400% as much music as other bots using our new advanced audio mixing technology (which we totally didn't
        copy from GitHub).</p>
    <p>Why wait for other people's trashy music to finish playing when you can just add your own on top? Unlike
        FredBoat, the improved edition has no objections to clearing other folk's tracks.</p>
